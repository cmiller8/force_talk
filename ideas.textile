"Gist":https://gist.github.com/christophermanning/4527513

* has controls to modify components of force

<pre>
var frictionChanger = fl.add(config, "friction", 0, 1)
frictionChanger.onChange(function(value) {
  force.friction(value)
  force.start()
})
</pre>

looks like it uses "dat-gui":http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/
